Incoming Systems Engineering Intern in the Networking, Intelligent Cellular & Security (NICS) team at [CommScope](https://www.commscope.com). <br /> <br />
Iâ€™m a Master's student majoring in CS at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu). Previously, I was building streamline products at [Persistent](https://www.persistent.com/) to make open-source softwares more accessible to the community. I also know a bit about Data Science and I love to build and automate stuff.

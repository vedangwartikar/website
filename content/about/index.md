I'm a software engineer by day and a cinephile by night. Currently, I am working with [Persistent](https://www.persistent.com/) on [IBM's Power8](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/power) platform for the Open-Source community. I believe I have decent experience in Data Science, which I garnered during my internship at [Sirpi](https://www.sirpi.io/), a start-up based out in Bangalore. Prior to that, I interned at a FinTech start-up [RhythmFlows](https://rhythmflows.com/) where I lead a small team for 4 interns for an Analytics and a Bank Reconciliation project.

I'm a huge fan of the open-source community and I have self-hosted my own movie, photo and cloud server on a VPS. Here's a self-hosted photo from the trek - [Andharban Valley](https://photos.vedang.dev/share/xPLqlNry) which I recently visited, and here's my [Self-hosted Resume](https://resume.vedang.dev/).
